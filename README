The JKDownloadManager class can be used to perform multiple downloads at once. It manages instances of the JKDownload class to perform those downloads. A JKDownload object itself is capable of downloading the data and you can use it without the JKDownloadManager, you only need the manager to perform multiple downloads at once.
